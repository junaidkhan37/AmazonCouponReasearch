Overview 

In this practical assignment of the program, we will have to answer the question, “Will a customer accept the coupon?” The goal of this project was to check the capability of us about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those who did not.


Data

This data is from the Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, and passenger, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. There are three possible answers people can choose from:
“Right away” “Later, before the coupon expires” “No, I do not want the coupon”
The first two responses are labeled as “Y = 1,” and the third is labeled as “Y = 0.” There are five different types of coupons: Less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carryout and takeaway, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($$20), coffee houses, carryout and takeaway, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50)


CONCLUSION

Keeping in mind the dataset we have for the Amazon customers here is showing that if the Amaznon customer is a Single(60.59%) Male(59.07%) under the Age of 21(59.08%) and heading to no Urgent Place(63.37%) on a Sunny Day(59.47%) riding with Friends(67.34%) would have the higghest chances of accepting Caryy Out and Take Away(73.54%) coupons most probably right away
